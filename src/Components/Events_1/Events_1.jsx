                            <p>Palestinian society is currently facing its most horrific challenge. Israel’s genocidal
                                assault has killed many tens of thousands and displaced more than 85% of Gaza’s
                                population since October. Across their homeland and in exile, Palestinians are
                                subjected to a system of oppression that is recognised internationally
                                as meeting the legal definition of the crime of apartheid.</p>
                            <p>Trade union members have been at the forefront of the fight back against
                                the increasingly genocidal actions of the state of Israel. Including the
                                tens of thousands who have joined the huge national protest in London and
                                around the country, leading actions of all kinds, including in their workplace
                                and in their local areas, demanding an end to British
                                state, corporate and institutional complicity in Israel’s crimes.</p>
                            <p>We need to continue the fight and it is our duty as trade unionists
                                and activists in the UK to escalate our solidarity, for freedom, equality
                                and justice for the Palestinian people.</p>
                            <p>This conference will hear from key Palestinian voices, as
                                well as leaders of the UK trade union movement, on what we need to do next in solidarity with
                                Palestine. This includes stepping up the divestment campaigns targeting all institutions complici
                                t with Israel’s crimes. There also needs to be renewed focus on the fightback against normalisation,
                                 to challenge the attempts to sidetrack the core solidarity work against Israel’s genocidal assault. And just as importantly we need to continue to engage and highlight the ongoing campaigns, taking place in all unions, to create the space and offer resources to support activists relentlessly championing justice,
                                equality and freedom for the Palestinian people in their unions.</p>
                            <p>We need to stand strong and united, against genocide and apartheid, for justice
                                 and peace in Palestine.</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>The conference will include panel sessions on Palestinian workers bearing
                                the weight of genocide
                                and apartheid and the next steps for the trade union movement.</p>
                            <p> And here will be seminar sessions discussing the following topics: <br />– Divest for Palestine – Focus on Divestment campaings as part of BDS <br />
                                – Defending Palestinian Rights: Solidarity – Not Normalisation and Apartheid <br />
                                – Organising for Palestine in your Trade Union – What you can do in your TU to continue to push for a free Palestine </p>
