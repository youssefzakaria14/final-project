                                        The Uk government’s delay in making a decision on whether to
                                        stop arms exports to Israel is unconscionable. It is at total odds with
                                        Britain’s clear moral and legal responsibility not to render aid and
                                        assistance to Israel’s genocide in the Gaza Strip, its unlawful military
                                        occupation of the West Bank including East Jerusalem, and
                                        its regime of apartheid against all Palestinians.

                                        In the past week alone, Israel’s ground invasion of Khan Younis
                                        has killed dozens of Palestinians, displacing 190,000 people.
                                        Last Saturday, Israel once again bombed a school sheltering
                                        displaced Palestinians in Deir al-Balah, killing over 30 Palestinians.
                                        In the occupied West Bank, Israel continues its military invasions and
                                        assassinations
                                        of Palestinians, with at least 554 Palestinians killed since October 2023.

                                        The UK’s deadly arms trade with Israel includes its contribution to the F-16
                                        and F-35 fighter jets that Israel is using in its bombardment of the Gaza Strip.
                                        15% of every F35 that Israel is using to bomb Gaza is made by British industry.
                                        The Israeli military has armed these jets with 2,000lb bombs, explosives with a
                                        lethal radius up to 365m. A UN report found that these bombs have
                                        been used in ’emblematic’
                                        cases of indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks on Gaza.

                                    The government’s own Strategic Export Licensing Criteria, under which all arms exports are assessed,
                                     states that export licences should not be issued if there is a “clear risk” arms
                                      exports might be used in a “serious violation of international humanitarian law”. The Arms Trade Treaty, to which Britain is a State Party, outlines that a State must not
                                       export arms if there is “potential” that they could be used to commit
                                        violations of international human rights or humanitarian law. It is inconceivable that after over 75 years of Israel’s regime of military occupation and apartheid, and nearly 10 months of Israel’s genocidal assault on Palestinians in Gaza, with over 40,000 killed, that the government’s legal 
                                    advice has adjudged that such a risk does not exist.

                                    In January, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the world’s highest court,
                                     found it plausible that Israel is breaching the Genocide Convention in its assault on
                                      Palestinians in Gaza. Israel has ignored the binding interim measures adopted by the Court.
                                       In a separate opinion issued last week, the ICJ ordered Israel
                                     to end its illegal military occupation of Palestinian land.

                                    In April, the UN Human Rights Council called on all states “to cease the sale,
                                     transfer and diversion of arms, munitions and other military equipment to Israel” as
                                      an urgent measure to prevent further violations of international law. In June, UN experts
                                       announced that States and companies must end arms transfers to Israel immediately or risk
                                        responsibility for human rights violations, “possibly including genocide”. They specified 
                                        that this “must include indirect transfers through intermediary countries that could ultimately
                                         be used by
                                     Israeli forces, particularly in the ongoing attacks on Gaza.”
